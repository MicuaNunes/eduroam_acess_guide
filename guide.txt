This process consists in changing 2 files.
In order to change files use nano editor.

FIRST:
write the contents of interfaces_file located in the repository to the raspberry pi interfaces file using the next command to acess the file

: sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

NOTE: to save click "ctrl-O" and press "Enter" to save in the same file. "ctrl-X" closes the editor

SECOND:
add the contents of the credentials_file to the wpa_supplicant file using the next command to acess the file. Change the identity and password fields with your own.

: sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

THIRD:
download the certificate "AddTrust External CA Root para Windows/Linux/MAC (certificado de seguran√ßa tipo CER - 2 Kb)" 
from https://www.ua.pt/stic/PageText.aspx?id=15224

move the file to /etc/ssl/certs
reboot.

When the raspberry reboots it should connect automatically to eduroam.
Have fun.
